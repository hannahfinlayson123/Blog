        <h1>Week 1 - Introduction</h1>
        <p>This week we had a short introduction session where we were introduced to the teaching team, assignments, and how the course works, and then we had to create our own name cards introducing ourselves on Figma. What I took away from this first lesson was that I will be fully supported by the teaching team with my mental health, the assignments look like a lot of fun, and I am already familiar with the use of Figma so I can use that as an advantage when it comes to Assignment 2.1. Regarding Assignment 2.2, I am unfamiliar with coding and have never done it before. Therefore, I will need to pay extra attention and ask for help when the time comes around. Before next week's class, I will start thinking about what fictional character I can use for Assignment 1.</p>

        <h1>Week 2 - Assignment 1 / Persona</h1>
        <p>Today I properly learned what the definition and look of a persona was. I always had an idea but it was confirmed for me what a persona was and what it was made up of such as demographics, interests, goals, motivations, pain points, and frustrations. It was so interesting to see the history of web design and how much it has evolved over the last 20-30 years. So interesting to compare the two due to loading time, space on computers, using gifs and photos, etc. By learning what a proper persona is, I can now apply the thought process of a persona to web design. When designing a website, you must consider who you are designing it for. Therefore, a persona will be very beneficial when creating a web design as you will always have your key audience in mind.</p>

        <h1>Week 3 - Assignment 1 / Venn Diagram</h1>
        <p>Our group chose The Victoria University Nuku page. The Venn Diagram shows how the goals of the designer, users, students, and community all overlap and are important for creating a good home page for students. By considering all of these goals, ultimately a good home page will help students learn and succeed in their courses. It felt great turning up to class this week with a lot of work done and feeling confident about it. I’m looking forward to getting some feedback and clarity from the tutors so that I can build my confidence moving forward in this assignment. I found the Venn Diagram exercise really helpful in understanding how designers, users, and the community all play an important role in creating a great user experience. I’m excited to use this approach in my own work and create better designs that meet my user's needs.</p>

        <h1>Week 4 - Assignment 1 / Journey Map and User Flow Diagram</h1>
        <p>This week we learned about customer journey maps and user flow diagrams. I have done both in the first-year Interaction course but I’m feeling lost in remembering how they work. I found this class helpful and informative as I can revert back to the slides if I ever need help or assistance. Learning about the anatomy of user flows with shapes and what they are used for was so interesting and definitely something I will be implementing in my own work. Before next week's class, I will do my customer journey map and user flow to get my final feedback before writing my rationale.</p>

        <h1>Week 5 - Assignment 1 / Project 1 Feedback</h1>
        <p>This week the class was very short due to the majority of the class time being dedicated to Project 1 feedback and support. I received feedback from Shiv regarding my assignment 1. He stated that for my journey map, I need to look into describing why my users feels the way they do during different parts of their experience. This includes some sort of visual graph to help show the rise and decline of emotions. I took on this feedback and added some more detail to my journey map and elaborated a bit more and showed a decline and rise of the emotions to make the different emotions more obvious. I also re-did my whole user flow diagram as I was unhappy with it and Shiv told me it didn’t have enough steps expanding on the user flow diagram to show every small interaction.</p>

        <h1>Week 6 - Assignment 2.1 Introduction</h1>
        <p>In today’s class, we were informed about Assignment 2.1. We’ll be doing iteration after finding research and defining the project scope. I’ve found out the goal is to create a seamless web experience. I'll be making two web pages, probably the hoe and product pages, ensuring they work on both desktop and mobile. For now, I'm focusing on the wireframe designs over the holidays. I will make fast and quick iterations of where I think things will go. Starting with grayscale wireframes featuring placeholder content, I'll eventually refine the design with detailed elements like fonts, colors, and interactions. From now on, I'll develop a style guide to maintain a consistent look throughout the project, including components like colour palettes and fonts.I will pay attention to colour selection, opting for RGB which suits web design. Accessibility is also key, ensuring my design works well for everyone. Lastly, I'll consider accessibility guidelines and SEO best practices to enhance the chances of my website being on the first page of Google.</p>

        <h1>Week 7 - Assignment 2.1</h1>
        <p>For Assignment 2.1, I made all of my wireframes over the holidays for both the home and product pages. It was exciting to see my ideas come to life. Once back from the break, I made my medium-fidelity versions, and that’s when things really started to look and feel more real. As I approached the final prototype, I couldn’t help but become a bit of a perfectionist. I designed mock-up product images and received feedback from tutors and friends. Overall, I’m really pleased with the progress my website has made and the level of dedication I’ve put into this assignment. It’s been a rewarding experience that has brought my project to a point that pretty much exceeds my initial expectations.</p>

        <h1>Week 8 - Assignment 2.2 Brief</h1>
        <p>During this weeks lecture we were introduced to the brief for Assignment 2.2. Straight away I saw the percentage different between Assignment 2.2 and Assignment 3 - meaning if I was to code Assignment 3, this would put a lot of pressure on myself to make it look and work good. Therefore, I took to route of coding my website for Assignment 2.2 on Visual Studio Code. I found W3schools extremely helpful as I used a lot of their templates and it helped set me up seeing as I have never coded anything before. Although, after receiving multiple amounts of feedback from Shiv, I soon realised I was putting html and css coding in the wrong files and ultimately, I’d get marked down for the way in which I was coding my website. I soon got very frustrated with coding and nothing was going right and it was taking way too long, I ended up looking into CMS. This process was much more efficient and i had so much fun learning how to use Editor X. </p>

        <h1>Week 9 - Responsiveness</h1>
        <p>Today we were informed on how to make your website responsive and why it is so important. A  responsive website ensures a smooth experience for users on various screen sizes and devices. By doing this, it improves user satisfaction, SEO rankings, and conversion rates. A responsive website is essential for reaching a wider audience and maximising online effectiveness. After some testing of my website, I noticed a lot of my elements on my website overlapped and just went ugly when changing the size of my browser. So I had to do a lot of playing around with making some elements fixed and some fluid to ensure maximal responsiveness. I did have to ask Shiv a few questions here and there but independently I managed to use Editor X well and I found the whole experience very enjoyable.</p>

        <h1>Week 10 - Assignment 2.2 Submission</h1>
        <p>This week Shiv and Jamie showed us their blog demos. Both of them were coded so I know that's what mine may potentially look like. Shiv's blog was very bold in colour and he clearly used grids with images and text in boxes on his home page. I really liked the clean and uniform look of his box grids which makes me want to try use them as well to have this nice look for my blog. His page for each blog post wasn't that aesthetically pleasing due to the bright orange background colour and large image, I found it took away from the actual text and I found the size of the text too difficult to read. I now know Shiv has some good and not so good points I can implement in my own blog. Jamie's blog was more my style with a couple of colours and a minimalistic layout. I liked the simplicity of his bog posts as they showed exactly what you wanted to see; the date, the title of each post, and the reflection writing. I found Jamie's simple but so impactful as there wasn't a lot going on. I found this session very helpful as I can take away things I liked from both demos and I'm now looking forward to planning my own blog.</p>

        <h1>Week 11 - Assignment 2.2 Presentation</h1>
        <p>In the process of transforming my Figma design into a CMS version, I refined the website based on my personal preferences and feedback. The final design, prioritizes readability through the change in font and utilizes interactive elements for engagement. I simplified the product page by replacing the dropdown menus with direct buttons for faster selection. Accordions were used for product information, which enhanced clarity and familiarity. After struggling to figure out how to use horizontal scrolling, I chose to remove it which made a more user-friendly experience. And finally, I felt like the website process didn’t feel complete so I added a pop-up window for adding items to the cart.</p>

        <h1>Week 12 - Overall thought about the course</h1>
        <p>Looking back on my experience in the IXXN221 course, the young tutors brought a fresh, relatable vibe to the class. Their modern perspectives clicked with my own style, making feedback sessions engaging. The short classes were great, but I didn’t quite get the need for the break, as I never lost focus. The workload felt just right, letting me dive deep without feeling too overwhelmed. Huge shoutout to Shiv for always being there with quick and helpful feedback. Yet, I found the project briefs a bit of a struggle. They lacked detail, leaving me with lots of questions. Having more thorough briefs with examples could have made a real difference, saving me from bugging the tutors so much. Despite these hiccups, I’m keen to continue with this course in my third year. The tutors’ modern approach and the manageable workload made it a cool experience!</p>
